    "### Overview of what I did\n",
    "\n",
    "I used your financial models to **simulate a monthly “user base” using website sessions as the proxy for users**, then projected how that base evolves over **48 months**, separating **new vs returning users** and plotting growth/decline trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core starting point is the `DRE` sheet from `cenario-gpt`, where month 1 has:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Sessões` (sessions) = 30,000\n",
    "\n",
    "From there I created a 4‑year scenario with different growth phases and generated two visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the head of the simulated user table (first 5 months):\n",
    "\n",
    "{outputs_dict['f4ec2010']}\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions used for the simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "To move forward without overcomplicating:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User proxy**: I used `Sessões` as *monthly active user* proxy (each session ≈ one user interaction).\n",
    "- **Horizon**: 48 months, to match the Julius P&L horizon.\n",
    "- **Growth pattern** (MoM growth on sessions):\n",
    "  - Months 1–12: **+8%** per month (launch & ramp‑up)\n",
    "  - Months 13–24: **+4%** per month (growth, but decelerating)\n",
    "  - Months 25–36: **+2%** per month (maturing)\n",
    "  - Months 37–48: **–1%** per month (plateau / slight decline, saturation or reduced investment)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **New vs returning users**:\n",
    "  - Start with **70% of sessions as new users** in month 1\n",
    "  - New user share decreases by 1 percentage point per month, bottoming at 20%\n",
    "  - Returning users = Sessions – NewUsers\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives a realistic trajectory: **high acquisition dependency early on**, then **increasing weight of returning users** as the brand builds a base.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Simulated monthly sessions (user base)\n",

    "This chart shows the total simulated sessions per month over 48 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "{image_urls_dict['654b6f79']}\n",

    "\n",
    "- The curve **rises quickly in the first year**, driven by the +8% MoM growth.\n",
    "- Growth **slows but continues upward** through years 2 and 3.\n",
    "- In year 4, sessions **flatten and slightly decline**, capturing a likely saturation or lower marketing push.\n",

    "You can read this as the **top‑of‑funnel user base trajectory** if you maintain your assumed CAC/ROAS and traffic investments.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. New vs returning users over time\n",
    "\n",
    "This stacked area chart shows how much of that base is **new users** vs **returning users**.\n",
    "\n",
    "{image_urls_dict['34f915a1']}\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key takeaway**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Early months: the base is **dominated by new users** (launch and acquisition heavy).\n",
    "- Over time: the **returning user layer thickens** as you accumulate past customers/visitors.\n",
    "- This is what you want in a healthy D2C: **less dependence on constant new acquisition** and more value from your existing base.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpreting growth/decline trends\n",
    "\n",
    "**Growth phase (Months 1–24)**  \n",
    "- Strong **compounding of users**; the base more than doubles in this period.\n",
    "- If your **conversion rate and AOV remain stable**, this should track roughly with **revenue growth**, assuming spend scales accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Maturation phase (Months 25–36)**  \n",
    "- Growth is still positive but **slower**.\n",
    "- At this point, **incremental revenue from new users is smaller** relative to the contribution from retention and frequency of existing customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plateau / mild decline (Months 37–48)**  \n",
    "- Slight **negative MoM growth** in sessions.\n",
    "- This is a warning zone where:\n",
    "  - Either **marketing efficiency**, **brand awareness**, or **category saturation** is limiting.\n",
    "  - Or you intentionally reduce acquisition spend and rely more on retention / unit economics.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How this ties back to the financial model\n",
    "\n",
    "- We started from **Month 1 sessions (30k)** given in your DRE.\n",
    "- The **shape** of the curve is designed to be consistent with many **early‑stage e‑commerce** cases: aggressive ramp → stabilization → plateau/decline.\n",
    "- You can directly relate this user base trajectory to:\n",
    "  - **Revenue**: Sessions × CR × AOV\n",
    "  - **CAC & ROAS**: if you assume a cost per session or keep CAC from the model, you can convert this into acquisition spend and efficiency.\n",
    "  - **LTV**: growing returning‑user share is consistent with your LTV> CAC logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggested next steps / further analyses\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’d like, I can next:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Overlay revenue**  \n",
    "   Use your AOV and conversion assumptions to turn this user curve into **monthly revenue**, and plot sessions vs revenue together.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Scenario comparison**  \n",
    "   Build **multiple user growth scenarios**:\n",
    "   - Base (current one)\n",
    "   - Optimistic (higher sustained growth, better retention)\n",
    "   - Pessimistic (slower ramp, earlier plateau)  \n",
    "   Then quantify the **gap in total users and revenue** over 48 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Retention and cohort logic**  \n",
    "   Replace the simple new/returning split with a **cohort‑based retention model** (e.g. % of month‑N users returning at N+1, N+2, etc.) for more precise LTV/user base evolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Link to marketing budget**  \n",
    "   Use your CAC & ROAS assumptions to simulate:\n",
    "   - Sessions driven by **paid media vs organic**.\n",
    "   - Effect of **increasing/decreasing marketing budget** on user base curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you tell me which of these you care about most, I can build that directly on top of this simulation."

    "In the Julius `store-sells` and P&L, there is a **ROAS by channel and keyword curve** that declines gradually over time. That’s the model telling you:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Early on**: You can maintain ROAS around 3.9–4+ and CAC within target.\n",
    "- **Later**: Incremental customers cost more; ROAS and CAC degrade.\n",

    "  - CR ≈ 3%, AOV 200, margin/order 64, CAC 40.\n",
    "- **LTV** ≈ 192 margin per customer vs CAC 40 → plenty of room.\n",

    "  - Sessions increase.\n",
    "  - Orders and revenue increase.\n",
    "  - Contribution margin grows faster than fixed costs.\n",
    "- Over time:\n",
    "  - You move from **EBIT loss** (–75k) to break-even to positive EBIT.\n",
    "  - Retention and repeat orders increase the share of returning users.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decline loop (when the key levers worsen)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CAC increases** and/or **ROAS falls**.\n",
    "- **CR and AOV soften** due to broader, colder traffic or discounting.\n",
    "- **Order frequency is lower** than planned (LTV down).\n",
    "- Suddenly:\n",
    "  - You have **less margin per customer** to pay for acquisition.\n",
    "  - You are forced to **cut media**, which slows traffic growth.\n",
    "  - With slower traffic and orders, **fixed costs remain high**, keeping you in negative EBIT longer.\n",

    "\n",
    "Not just CAC, but **CAC at the true revenue-generating level**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- CAC-to-verified vs CAC-to-funded vs CAC-to-TAU.\n",

    "Drivers:\n",
    "\n",

    "- Measure:\n",
    "  - Time-to-first-funding\n",
    "  - Time-to-first-transaction\n",
    "  - % of users hitting key “aha” moments in Week 1\n",

    "For sustainable growth, aim for **healthy ARPU without over-monetizing early**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tactics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start with the **cleanest, most aligned revenue streams**:\n",
    "  - Interchange on card spend\n",
    "  - FX spreads and transaction fees that users understand\n",
    "  - Simple subscription tiers for premium features\n",
    "- Introduce **credit and more complex products** gradually, with:\n",
    "  - Conservative risk models (start small limits, iterate)\n",
    "  - Clear communication of costs and risks to users\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimize ARPU by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Segmenting users (mass, affluent, SMEs, freelancers, migrants, etc.)\n",
    "- Bundling products where it improves experience and margin (e.g. multi-currency + card + insurance)\n",
    "\n",
    "Strategic principle: **ARPU growth should come from deeper, healthier engagement**, not from obscure fees or high-risk credit expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.4 Retention & engagement\n",
    "\n",
    "Retention is where sustainability lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Focus on:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Making the fintech app a **daily or weekly habit**:\n",
    "  - Salary deposit as main account\n",
    "  - Bills and recurring payments\n",
    "  - Everyday card payments\n",
    "- Personalized nudges:\n",

    "Measure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cohort retention and cohort ARPU\n",
    "- Migration of users from **light** to **medium/heavy** usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Strategic principle: **optimize for depth of relationship, not just breadth of acquisition**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.5 Risk management and regulatory alignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Especially for credit or multi-jurisdiction operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build a **robust risk framework** early:\n",
    "  - Credit scoring and affordability checks\n",
    "  - Fraud detection\n",
    "  - AML/KYC procedures that are both tight and UX-friendly\n",
    "- Maintain a **strong relationship with regulators**:\n",
    "  - Pre-emptively align on new products\n",
    "  - Avoid business models that may get banned or heavily constrained later\n",
    "\n",
    "Strategic principle: growth that depends on “regulatory arbitrage” is rarely sustainable.\n",

    "\n",
    "- How aggressively can we grow without:\n",

    "  - Extending payback beyond X months?\n",
    "  - Exceeding the capital we can realistically raise?\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendations:\n",
    "\n",

    "  - Minimum acceptable LTV/CAC (e.g. 3x by cohort at month 24)\n",
    "  - Maximum CAC payback period (e.g. 18 months)\n",
    "  - Maximum cash burn and minimum runway\n",
    "- Stage your capital raising and growth pushes around **milestones**:\n",
    "  - Prove unit economics in a narrow segment or geography\n",
    "  - Then scale horizontally / vertically\n",

    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Fintech startups have fundamentally reshaped how money moves, how people and businesses access financial services, and how the underlying infrastructure works. Their story is a mix of **big contributions and real impact**, paired with **recurring failures and systemic risks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a structured summary of the major **contributions, impacts, successes, and failures**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Major contributions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1 Financial inclusion and access\n",
    "\n",
    "Fintech has:\n",
    "- Brought **bank-like services** (accounts, payments, credit) to people previously excluded from traditional banking, especially in emerging markets.\n",
    "- Enabled **mobile-first banking** and wallets so users don’t need branches or even a formal address.\n",
    "- Used **alternative data** (mobile usage, e-commerce history, social signals) to underwrite people without formal credit histories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Net effect: more people can **store value safely, receive money, pay, and occasionally borrow**, often for the first time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2 User experience and product design\n",
    "\n",
    "Fintech startups redefined expectations for money products by:\n",
    "- Making onboarding **fast, digital, and mobile-first** (minutes vs days or weeks).\n",
    "- Turning confusing tasks (investing, budgeting, splitting bills) into **simple, guided flows**.\n",
    "- Bringing **transparent pricing and real-time notifications**, which increased perceived control and trust for users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional institutions have had to **upgrade UX and digital channels** in response.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3 Cost and efficiency improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "On both consumer and B2B sides, fintech has:\n",
    "- **Lowered transaction costs** (P2P payments, remittances, foreign exchange) compared to incumbents.\n",
    "- Automated back-office and compliance processes using:\n",
    "  - APIs\n",
    "  - Cloud-native systems\n",
    "  - AI/ML for fraud and risk\n",
    "- Provided **infrastructure as a service** (payments, KYC, lending, banking-as-a-service) so others don’t need to rebuild core rails.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has **expanded the number of financial products** in the market and cut costs for many.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.4 Innovation in credit, payments, and investing\n",
    "\n",
    "Fintechs pioneered or mainstreamed:\n",
    "- **Digital-only neobanks** with low/no fees.\n",
    "- **BNPL** and flexible installment products.\n",
    "- **Instant P2P payments** and QR-based systems.\n",
    "- **Robo-advisors**, micro-investing, and fractional shares.\n",
    "- **Embedded finance** (financial services built into non-financial products: marketplaces, vertical SaaS, gig platforms).\n",
    "\n",
    "Result: users now expect **speed, flexibility, and personalization** in core financial products.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.5 Data, APIs, and open banking\n",
    "\n",
    "Fintech pushed forward:\n",
    "- **Open banking / open finance** standards, giving users control of their data and allowing them to plug it into multiple apps.\n",
    "- API-based access to:\n",
    "  - Account data\n",
    "  - Transaction feeds\n",
    "  - Payment initiation\n",
    "  - KYC/KYB and identity services\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 2.1 On consumers\n",
    "\n",
    "Positive impacts:\n",
    "- Better **pricing** (lower fees, better FX, more transparent costs).\n",
    "- **Convenience and speed** in day-to-day money tasks.\n",
    "- Greater **engagement with personal finances** via real-time insights and nudges.\n",
    "- Access to **credit or savings/investment products** they previously couldn’t get.\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative or mixed impacts:\n",
    "- Overuse of **easy credit/BNPL**, especially among younger or vulnerable users.\n",
    "- Information overload and **app fatigue** (too many tools, not enough holistic control).\n",
    "- Higher **exposure to scams** in faster, digital channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2 On businesses and the economy\n",
    "\n",
    "- SMEs got **easier access to payments, lending, and working capital**, often underserved by big banks.\n",
    "- New rails (instant payments, embedded finance) **oiled e-commerce and gig economies**.\n",
    "- Fintech created **new job categories**, from product and growth roles to risk and compliance in tech-native settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time:\n",
    "- Some fintech models **amplified leverage and risk** (e.g., lightly regulated lending, crypto leverage, synthetic assets).\n",
    "- Rapidly growing fintechs sometimes **strained existing regulatory frameworks**, forcing hurried adaptation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.3 On incumbents and the financial system\n",
    "\n",
    "- Banks and insurers were **forced to modernize tech stacks** and offer better digital experiences.\n",
    "- There has been more **partnership and M&A**:\n",
    "  - Banks using fintechs as vendors or distribution partners.\n",
    "  - Fintechs relying on licensed banks for core regulatory perimeter.\n",
    "- Systemically, fintech has contributed to:\n",
    "  - **More redundancy** (alternative providers and infrastructure).\n",
    "  - But also **new concentration points** (e.g., single API providers that many apps depend on).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Major successes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1 Category-defining companies\n",
    "\n",
    "Across payments, neobanking, investing, and lending, some fintechs have:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Achieved **massive scale** (tens or hundreds of millions of users).\n",
    "- Built strong **unit economics**:\n",
    "  - Low CAC via viral/organic channels and smart onboarding.\n",
    "  - High LTV via cross-sell (card + loans + savings + investing, etc.).\n",
    "- Reached **profitability or clear path to profitability**, often with multiple revenue streams:\n",
    "  - Interchange and transaction fees\n",
    "  - Interest income and spreads\n",
    "  - Subscription/FX/processing fees\n",
    "  - B2B SaaS or API revenues\n",
    "\n",
    "They set the template for:\n",
    "- **“Banking as a feature”** embedded in other apps.\n",
    "- **API-first infrastructure** that powers entire ecosystems.\n",
    "- **Platform models** where users can manage many aspects of financial life in one interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2 Proving new business models\n",
    "\n",
    "Fintech startups successfully proved:\n",
    "- **Neobanks and wallets** can scale without physical branches.\n",
    "- **Robo-advisors** can serve mass-market investing at low ticket sizes.\n",
    "- **Peer-to-peer and marketplace lending** (although this story is mixed) can supplement traditional lending.\n",
    "- **Payment aggregators and gateways** can own the merchant relationship and extract meaningful margin, not just be low-margin utilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "These successes **expanded the imagination** of what financial services can look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Major failures and recurring problems\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.1 Unit economics and growth-at-all-costs\n",
    "\n",
    "Many fintechs:\n",
    "- Chased **topline growth and user numbers** without:\n",
    "  - Proving unit economics,\n",
    "  - Understanding risk behavior over time,\n",
    "  - Or validating business models under stress scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common patterns:\n",
    "- High **CAC** driven by paid acquisition and promotions, with:\n",
    "  - Weak retention,\n",
    "  - Low ARPU,\n",
    "  - Long and uncertain payback.\n",
    "- Underpriced products (e.g., loans, FX, zero-fee everything) to gain share, assuming **economics will be fixed later**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Result: a lot of companies hit **growth ceilings** or burned through capital without reaching sustainable economics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.2 Risk mispricing and credit losses\n",
    "\n",
    "In credit-heavy models:\n",
    "- Over-reliance on **limited or biased data** for underwriting.\n",
    "- Aggressive growth into **riskier segments** to sustain volume.\n",
    "- Inadequate **stress-testing** for macro downturns (unemployment, rate hikes).\n",
    "\n",
    "When conditions changed:\n",
    "- Default rates spiked.\n",
    "- Lenders had to **abruptly tighten credit**, shrinking growth and damaging brand.\n",
    "- Some platforms **failed outright** or had to be rescued.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.3 Compliance, governance, and fraud\n",
    "\n",
    "Fintechs sometimes:\n",
    "- Underinvested in **compliance, legal, and risk functions** early on.\n",
    "- Treated **KYC/AML/sanctions** as a box-ticking exercise, not a core competency.\n",
    "- Were hit by **fraud rings**, synthetic IDs, or merchant abuse that:\n",
    "  - Eroded margins,\n",
    "  - Attracted regulatory scrutiny,\n",
    "  - Damaged trust with partners.\n",
    "\n",
    "In worse cases, there were **governance failures**:\n",
    "- Misstated metrics,\n",
    "- Poor handling of customer funds,\n",
    "- Inadequate controls around lending or crypto custody.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.4 Overdependence on external partners and platforms\n",
    "\n",
    "Some fintechs built on:\n",
    "- Single **banking-as-a-service** vendors,\n",
    "- Single payment/acquiring partners,\n",
    "- Or single **cloud regions/infrastructure providers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Failures and outages at partners:\n",
    "- Caused **service interruptions**,\n",
    "- Limited the ability to differentiate,\n",
    "- Exposed systemic dependence and bargaining power issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.5 Misalignment with regulators or societal expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "Issues included:\n",
    "- Pushing **borderline-regulatory** products (e.g., quasi-deposits, grey-area securities).\n",
    "- Insufficient consumer protection in **high-risk or high-cost products**.\n",
    "- Mismatched marketing (e.g., “investing is easy and safe” for high-volatility products).\n",
    "\n",
    "This created:\n",
    "- Backlash,\n",
    "- Forced product changes,\n",
    "- Sometimes sudden loss of key revenue lines.\n",

    "Fintech’s track record shows both **transformational value** and **repeatable mistakes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The big lessons are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sustainable fintech growth depends on:\n",
    "  - Solid **unit economics** (LTV/CAC, payback),\n",
    "  - Robust **risk and compliance** from day one,\n",
    "  - A strong **product/UX moat** that reduces CAC and increases retention.\n",

    "  - Solve **real, painful problems** (not just “make app prettier”),\n",
    "  - Own a **high-trust relationship** with users,\n",
    "  - Plug into the broader system through **APIs and partnerships**, not against it.\n",
    "- Many failures:\n",
    "  - Over-indexed on **fundraising, marketing, and “disruption” narrative**,\n",
    "  - Under-indexed on **risk, regulation, and profitability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’d like, I can next:\n",
    "- Map these successes/failures to a specific **fintech segment** (e.g., lending, neobanks, crypto, B2B payments), or  \n",

    "### Signatory Conclusion  \n",
    "\n",
    "On the basis of the financial models, user-growth simulations, and fintech best practices we’ve discussed, our shared conclusion is straightforward:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bebidasem – and any fintech-inspired, data-driven business – reaches sustainable growth not by chasing maximal top-line at all costs, but by rigorously managing the **link between users, unit economics, and risk** over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The major levers are clear:  \n",
    "acquiring the *right* customers at a rational **CAC**, converting them efficiently through a well-designed funnel, growing **ARPU and contribution margin** through product depth and retention, and continuously monitoring **risk, cash burn, and regulatory alignment**. Scenario-based planning and sensitivity analysis are not “nice-to-haves” here; they are essential to understanding how small shifts in CAC, conversion, retention, and cost structure can move your break-even point and fundamentally change the risk profile of the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our recommendation is to keep your growth model **cohort-based, transparent, and stress‑tested**:\n",
    "tie every acquisition dollar to LTV, track retention and engagement by cohort, and treat risk and compliance as first-order product constraints rather than back-office chores. When this discipline is in place, growth becomes both **scalable and survivable**—you’re not just growing fast, you’re growing in a way that can withstand shocks in funding markets, regulation, and competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that, we formally endorse the structured, data-driven, and scenario-oriented approach you’re taking as the right foundation for a resilient fintech/internet business.\n",
